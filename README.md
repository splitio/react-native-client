## Compatibility
The React Native SDK is a library for React Native applications. The library was build with native modules to support streaming in Android and iOS, and therefore it requires linking the native dependency in order to use streaming. For Expo applications, streaming is not supported by default but a polyfill can be used instead. Check our [public documentation](https://developer.harness.io/docs/feature-management-experimentation/sdks-and-infrastructure/client-side-sdks/react-native-sdk/) for installation details.

## Getting started
Below is a simple App.jsx example that describes the instantiation and most basic usage of our SDK:
```javascript
// Import the SDK
import { SplitFactory } from '@splitsoftware/splitio-react-native';

// Instantiate the SDK
var factory = SplitFactory({
  core: {
    authorizationKey: 'YOUR_SDK_KEY',
    key: 'CUSTOMER_ID'
  }
});

// Set a callback to listen for the SDK_READY event, to make sure the SDK is properly loaded before asking for a treatment
client.on(client.Event.SDK_READY, function() {
  var treatment = client.getTreatment('FEATURE_FLAG_NAME');
  if (treatment == 'on') {
    // insert code here for on treatment
  } else if (treatment == 'off') {
    // insert code here for off treatment
  } else {
    // insert your control treatment code here
  }
});
```
