 - Added `factory.destroy()` method, which invokes the `destroy` method of all clients created by the factory.
 - Updated @splitsoftware/splitio-commons package to version 2.0.0 that includes major updates and updated some transitive dependencies for vulnerability fixes.
 - BREAKING CHANGES:
    - @TODO Dropped support for Split Proxy v?.

0.10.0 (September 13, 2024)

 - Bugfixing - Restored some input validation error logs that were removed in version 0.8.0. The logs inform the user when the `getTreatment(s)` methods are called with an invalid value as feature flag name or flag set name.
 - Bugfixing - Fixed localhost mode to emit SDK_UPDATE when mocked feature flags are updated in the `features` object map of the config object (Related to issue https://github.com/splitio/javascript-browser-client/issues/119).

0.9.0 (May 6, 2024)
 - Updated @splitsoftware/splitio-commons package to version 1.14.0 that includes minor updates:
    - Added support for targeting rules based on semantic versions (https://semver.org/).
    - Added special impression label "targeting rule type unsupported by sdk" when the matcher type is not supported by the SDK, which returns 'control' treatment.
    - Updated Split API client to include the flags spec version query parameter for the `splitChanges` and `auth` endpoints.

0.8.1 (March 4, 2023)
 - Updated @splitsoftware/splitio-commons package to version 1.13.1 and some transitive dependencies for vulnerability fixes.
 - Updated evaluation flow to log a warning when using flag sets that don't contain cached feature flags.

0.8.0 (November 3, 2023)
 - Added support for Flag Sets on the SDK, which enables grouping feature flags and interacting with the group rather than individually (more details in our documentation):
   - Added new variations of the get treatment methods to support evaluating flags in given flag set/s.
     - getTreatmentsByFlagSet and getTreatmentsByFlagSets
     - getTreatmentWithConfigByFlagSets and getTreatmentsWithConfigByFlagSets
   - Added a new optional Split Filter configuration option. This allows the SDK and Split services to only synchronize the flags in the specified flag sets, avoiding unused or unwanted flags from being synced on the SDK instance, bringing all the benefits from a reduced payload.
   - Added `sets` property to the `SplitView` object returned by the `split` and `splits` methods of the SDK manager to expose flag sets on flag views.
 - Added `defaultTreatment` property to the `SplitView` object returned by the `split` and `splits` methods of the SDK manager (Related to issue https://github.com/splitio/javascript-commons/issues/225).
 - Added support for MacOS and TvOS platforms (Related to issue https://github.com/splitio/react-native-client/issues/63).
 - Updated @splitsoftware/splitio-commons package to version 1.11.0 that includes vulnerability fixes, support for Flag Sets, and adds the `defaultTreatment` property to the `SplitView` object.
 - Updated react-native dependency to version 0.72.6 for vulnerability fixes and validation.

0.7.0 (August 31, 2023)
 - Updated @splitsoftware/splitio-commons package to version 1.9.0 that includes a minor improvement:
   - Updated streaming architecture implementation to apply feature flag updates from the notification received which is now enhanced, improving efficiency and reliability of the whole update system.
 - Updated some transitive dependencies for vulnerability fixes.
 - Updated Android build.gradle config for compatibility with upcoming React Native v0.73 while keeping backward compatibility (Related to https://github.com/splitio/react-native-client/pull/54).

0.6.3 (May 15, 2023)
 - Updated @splitsoftware/splitio-commons package to version 1.8.2 that includes updated terminology on codebase to be more aligned with current standard without causing a breaking change. The core change is the term split for feature flag on things like logs and IntelliSense comments.
 - Updated some transitive dependencies for vulnerability fixes.

0.6.2 (March 15, 2023)
 - Updated @splitsoftware/splitio-commons package to version 1.8.1 that includes minor improvements.
 - Updated some transitive dependencies for vulnerability fixes.

0.6.1 (December 2, 2022)
- Updated some dependencies for vulnerability fixes.
- Bugfixing - Fixed uncaught error when calling the client `destroy` method in react-native@0.70, caused by the usage of a deprecated method removed in react-native@0.70 (https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/2596b2f6954362d2cd34a1be870810ab90cbb916) (Related to issue https://github.com/splitio/react-native-client/issues/38).

0.6.0 (October 5, 2022)
- Added a new impressions mode for the SDK called NONE, to be used in factory when there is no desire to capture impressions on an SDK factory to feed Split's analytics engine. Running NONE mode, the SDK will only capture unique keys evaluated for a particular feature flag instead of full blown impressions.
- Updated default value of `scheduler.featuresRefreshRate` config parameter from 30 seconds to 60 seconds.
- Updated the synchronization flow to be more reliable in the event of an edge case generating delay in cache purge propagation, keeping the SDK cache properly synced.
- Updated @splitsoftware/splitio-commons package to version 1.7.1, that improves the performance of feature flag evaluations, among other improvements.

0.5.0 (July 6, 2022)
- Added a new config option to control the tasks that listen or poll for updates on feature flags and segments, via the new config `sync.enabled`. Running online Split will always pull the most recent updates upon initialization, this only affects updates fetching on a running instance. Useful when a consistent session experience is a must or to save resources when updates are not being used.
- Updated telemetry logic to track the anonymous config for user consent flag set to declined or unknown.
- Updated submitters logic, to avoid duplicating the post of impressions to Split cloud when the SDK is destroyed while its periodic post of impressions is running.
- Updated some dependencies, including react-native, for vulnerability fixes.
- Bugfixing - Updated submitters logic, to avoid dropping impressions and events that are being tracked while POST request is pending.

0.4.0 (May 24, 2022)
 - Added `scheduler.telemetryRefreshRate` property to SDK configuration.
 - Updated SDK telemetry storage, metrics and updater to be more effective and send less often.
 - Bugfixing - Updated default values for `scheduler.impressionsRefreshRate` config parameter: 300s for OPTIMIZED impression mode and 60s for DEBUG impression mode (previously it was 60s for both).

0.3.0 (April 7, 2022)
 - Added user consent feature to allow delaying or disabling the data tracking from SDK until user consent is explicitly granted or declined. Read more in our docs.

0.2.0 (March 31, 2022)
 - Added support to SDK clients to optionally bind attributes, keeping these loaded within the SDK along with the user ID, for easier usage when requesting flag.
 - Added `scheduler.impressionsQueueSize` property to SDK configuration (See https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/4406066357901-React-Native-SDK#configuration).
 - Updated some NPM dependencies for vulnerability fixes.
 - Bugfixing - Fixed validation of SDK configuration, to parse core.key into a string and log a warning when passing a number (Related to issue https://github.com/splitio/react-native-client/issues/19).

0.1.0 (October 20, 2021)
 - Added localhost mode support (Read more in our docs here: https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/4406066357901-React-Native-SDK#localhost-mode).
 - Updated @splitsoftware/splitio-commons dependency to version 1.0.0, which includes:
   - Updated localhost mode to emit SDK_READY_FROM_CACHE event in Browser when using localStorage (Related to issue https://github.com/splitio/react-client/issues/34).
   - Updated streaming logic to use the newest version of our streaming service, including:
     - Integration with Auth service V2, connecting to the new channels and applying the received connection delay.
     - Implemented handling of the new MySegmentsV2 notification types (SegmentRemoval, KeyList, Bounded and Unbounded)
     - New control notification for environment scoped streaming reset.
   - Fix of some log messages typos, among other improvements.
 - Updated some NPM dependencies for vulnerability fixes.

0.0.1 (July 29, 2021)
