0.6.3 (May 15, 2023)
 - Updated @splitsoftware/splitio-commons package to version 1.8.2 that includes updated terminology on codebase to be more aligned with current standard without causing a breaking change. The core change is the term split for feature flag on things like logs and IntelliSense comments.
 - Updated some transitive dependencies for vulnerability fixes.

0.6.2 (March 15, 2023)
 - Updated @splitsoftware/splitio-commons package to version 1.8.1 that includes minor improvements.
 - Updated some transitive dependencies for vulnerability fixes.

0.6.1 (December 2, 2022)
- Updated some dependencies for vulnerability fixes.
- Bugfixing - Fixed uncaught error when calling the client `destroy` method in react-native@0.70, caused by the usage of a deprecated method removed in react-native@0.70 (https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/2596b2f6954362d2cd34a1be870810ab90cbb916) (Related to issue https://github.com/splitio/react-native-client/issues/38).

0.6.0 (October 5, 2022)
- Added a new impressions mode for the SDK called NONE, to be used in factory when there is no desire to capture impressions on an SDK factory to feed Split's analytics engine. Running NONE mode, the SDK will only capture unique keys evaluated for a particular feature flag instead of full blown impressions.
- Updated default value of `scheduler.featuresRefreshRate` config parameter from 30 seconds to 60 seconds.
- Updated the synchronization flow to be more reliable in the event of an edge case generating delay in cache purge propagation, keeping the SDK cache properly synced.
- Updated @splitsoftware/splitio-commons package to version 1.7.1, that improves the performance of feature flag evaluations, among other improvements.

0.5.0 (July 6, 2022)
- Added a new config option to control the tasks that listen or poll for updates on feature flags and segments, via the new config sync.enabled . Running online Split will always pull the most recent updates upon initialization, this only affects updates fetching on a running instance. Useful when a consistent session experience is a must or to save resources when updates are not being used.
- Updated telemetry logic to track the anonymous config for user consent flag set to declined or unknown.
- Updated submitters logic, to avoid duplicating the post of impressions to Split cloud when the SDK is destroyed while its periodic post of impressions is running.
- Updated some dependencies, including react-native, for vulnerability fixes.
- Bugfixing - Updated submitters logic, to avoid dropping impressions and events that are being tracked while POST request is pending.

0.4.0 (May 24, 2022)
 - Added `scheduler.telemetryRefreshRate` property to SDK configuration.
 - Updated SDK telemetry storage, metrics and updater to be more effective and send less often.
 - Bugfixing - Updated default values for `scheduler.impressionsRefreshRate` config parameter: 300s for OPTIMIZED impression mode and 60s for DEBUG impression mode (previously it was 60s for both).

0.3.0 (April 7, 2022)
 - Added user consent feature to allow delaying or disabling the data tracking from SDK until user consent is explicitly granted or declined. Read more in our docs.

0.2.0 (March 31, 2022)
 - Added support to SDK clients to optionally bind attributes, keeping these loaded within the SDK along with the user ID, for easier usage when requesting flag.
 - Added `scheduler.impressionsQueueSize` property to SDK configuration (See https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/4406066357901-React-Native-SDK#configuration).
 - Updated some NPM dependencies for vulnerability fixes.
 - Bugfixing - Fixed validation of SDK configuration, to parse core.key into a string and log a warning when passing a number (Related to issue https://github.com/splitio/react-native-client/issues/19).

0.1.0 (October 20, 2021)
 - Added localhost mode support (Read more in our docs here: https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/4406066357901-React-Native-SDK#localhost-mode).
 - Updated @splitsoftware/splitio-commons dependency to version 1.0.0, which includes:
      - Updated localhost mode to emit SDK_READY_FROM_CACHE event in Browser when using localStorage (Related to issue https://github.com/splitio/react-client/issues/34).
      - Updated streaming logic to use the newest version of our streaming service, including:
            - Integration with Auth service V2, connecting to the new channels and applying the received connection delay.
            - Implemented handling of the new MySegmentsV2 notification types (SegmentRemoval, KeyList, Bounded and Unbounded)
            - New control notification for environment scoped streaming reset.
      - Fix of some log messages typos, among other improvements.
 - Updated some NPM dependencies for vulnerability fixes.

0.0.1 (July 29, 2021)
 - Initial public release. Check the official documentation for details: https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/4406066357901-React-Native-SDK
